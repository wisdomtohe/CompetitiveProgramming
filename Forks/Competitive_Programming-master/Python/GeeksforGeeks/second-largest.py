Given an array A of size N, print second largest element from an array.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains the N space seperated intgers of the array

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the second largest element.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1200

Example:
Input
2
5
89 24 75 11 23
6
56 42 21 23 65 20
Output
75
56
