# 10029 - Edit Step Ladders

An *edit step* is a transformation from one word *x* to another word *y* such that *x* and *y* are words
in the dictionary, and *x* can be transformed to *y* by adding, deleting, or changing one letter. So
the transformation from *dig* to *dog* or from *dog* to *do* are both edit steps. An *edit step ladder* is a
lexicographically ordered sequence of words *w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</Sub>, . . . , w<sub>n</sub>* such that 
the transformation from *w<sub>i</sub>* to *w<sub>i+1<sub>* is an edit step for all *i* from *1* to *n − 1*.
For a given dictionary, you are to compute the length of the longest edit step ladder


## Input

The input to your program consists of the dictionary – a set of lower case words in lexicographic order
– one per line. No word exceeds 16 letters and there are no more than 25000 words in the dictionary.


## Output

The output consists of a single integer, the number of words in the longest edit step ladder.


## Sample Input

```bash
cat
dig
dog
fig
fin
fine
fog
log
wine
```


## Sample Output

```bash
5
```
