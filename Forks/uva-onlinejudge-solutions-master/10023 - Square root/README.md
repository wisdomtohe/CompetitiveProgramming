You are to determinate *X* by given *Y* , from expression *X = √ Y*


## Input

Each test case of the input contains a positive integer *Y (1 ≤ Y ≤ 10<sup>1000</sup>)*, with no 
blanks or leading zeroes in it.
It is guaranteed, that for given *Y , X* will be always an integer.
Each test case will be separated by a single line.


## Output

For each test case, your program should print *X* in the same format as *Y* was given in input.
Print a blank line between the outputs for two consecutive test cases.


## Sample Input
