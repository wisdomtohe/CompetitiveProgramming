# 10198 - Counting
 
Gustavo knows how to count, but he is now learning how write numbers. As he is a very good student,
he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4. But he didn’t realize yet that 4 is different than 1, so he thinks that
4 is another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he created himself: he
make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values. For instance:  

```
132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6  
112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9 (remember that Gustavo thinks that 4 = 1)  
```

After making a lot of numbers in this way, Gustavo now wants to know how much numbers he
can create such that their sum is a number *n*. For instance, for *n* = 2 he noticed that he can make
5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and 2 (he knows how to count them up, but he doesn’t know how to write
five). However, he can’t figure it out for n greater than 2. So, he asked you to help him.


## Input

Input will consist on an arbitrary number of sets. Each set will consist on an integer n such that
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. You must read until you reach the end of file.


## Output

For each number read, you must output another number (on a line alone) stating how much numbers
Gustavo can make such that the sum of their digits is equal to the given number.


## Sample Input

```
2
3
```


## Sample Output

```
5
13
```
