/**
 * Colleen is turning  years old! Therefore, she has  candles of various heights on her cake, and candle  has height . Because the taller candles tower over the shorter ones, Colleen can only blow out the tallest candles.
 * 
 * Given the  for each individual candle, find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of candles on the cake. 
 * The second line contains  space-separated integers, where each integer  describes the height of candle .
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * Output Format
 * 1 <= height_i <= 10^7
 * Print the number of candles Colleen blows out on a new line.
 * 
 * Sample Input 0
 * 
 * 4
 * 3 2 1 3
 * Sample Output 0
 * 
 * 2
 * Explanation 0
 * 
 * We have one candle of height 1, one candle of height 2, and two candles of height 3. Colleen only blows out the tallest candles, meaning the candles where height = 3. Because there are 2 such candles, we print 2 on a new line.
